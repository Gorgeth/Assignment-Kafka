Task description

    Develop a SpringBoot microservice in Kotlin (or Java) that exposes REST interface and accepts customer address JSON payload in POST operation.
    Expose Swagger API definition for that interface.
    Define AVRO schema for JSON payload.
    Define Kafka producer inside the same microservice, that sends the same AVRO-based JSON payload to Kafka.
    Create a simple Kafka consumer as a SpringBoot microservice that reads this payload from Kafka and writes content to a file or any other sink.
    Commit the runnable code to Github.

 

Other instructions

    The candidate is free to make assumptions/choices wherever required and we would love to hear why he made them.
    Include a readme file in the git repo with instructions on how to run the application locally. Mention all assumptions/choices made in the readme. 

    For Kafka infrastructure, any available Docker compose can be used, or any cloud-based solution as well.
    If using any additional data sinks in step - 5, please make sure to dockerize them. For example, if using a Postgres database use a docker image.
    The candidate should explain/elaborate and demonstrate code upon finishing the task.
    Also, GitHub pull-request process should be elaborated/demonstrated.
